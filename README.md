# All of my codes for the modified fireflux_med case

the fireflux_med case study is the regular fireflux2 case, but dx and dy were changed to 10 instead of 5, and there have been different boundary conditions set for testing purposes.
This is mainly used for testing the fireflux2 case since it's half as big, but there isn't much sacrificed in terms of accuracy.
