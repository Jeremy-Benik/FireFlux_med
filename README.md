# All of my codes for the modified fireflux_med case

Please note this repository is no longer being updated or maintained as I was able to get a simulation with winds that were relatively close to observations. I will still keep these codes and I will go through and comment them, but there will not be anything else added to this repository. I would highly recommend checking out the FireFlux2 repository as that is where I will be working and making changes in the near future (1/18/2023)

the fireflux_med case study is the regular fireflux2 case, but dx and dy were changed to 10 instead of 5, and there have been different boundary conditions set for testing purposes.
This is mainly used for testing the fireflux2 case since it's half as big, but there isn't much sacrificed in terms of accuracy.
